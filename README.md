Instanews is a project for RED Academy's Full Time Web Development - Winter 2018 cohort. (This one is by Eric Chan)

    What does it do?

By utilizing GULP, SASS and JSON, we are able to grab articles from the New York Times API to display news in a mobile-first 
designed webpage.


        SASS(SCSS)

SASS allows us to work on our css in chunks by utilizing "partials" (denoted by a preceeding _ character for the scss files). This allows us to organize our CSS code so that is easy to read, anaylze and debug if there were any issues.
